- ✅ Comprehensive deployment guide (`DEPLOYMENT_VERCEL_RAILWAY.md`)

## 🎯 Quick Start Deployment

### Option 1: Automated Deployment
```bash
./deploy.sh
```
Choose option 1 to deploy everything.

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

#### Deploy Backend to Railway:
1. Create account at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Add PostgreSQL database
4. Set environment variables from `.env.railway`
5. Deploy!

#### Deploy Frontend to Vercel:
1. Create account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import GitHub repository
3. Set root directory to `apps/frontend`
4. Add environment variables from `.env.vercel`
5. Deploy!

## 📝 Environment Variables to Update

### In `.env.vercel`:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` - Set to your Railway backend URL

### In `.env.railway`:
- Database URL will be auto-provided by Railway
- All GitHub credentials are already configured

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Update GitHub OAuth App:**
   - Homepage: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
   - Callback: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/github`

2. **Run Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   railway run npm run db:migrate:deploy
   ```

3. **Test the Application:**
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Create a test task
   - Verify WebSocket connections work

## 💰 Expected Costs

- **Vercel**: Free tier (100GB bandwidth/month)
- **Railway**: ~$5-20/month (includes database)
- **Total**: $5-20/month for production deployment

## 📚 Documentation

- Full deployment guide: `DEPLOYMENT_VERCEL_RAILWAY.md`
- Original AWS guide: `DEPLOYMENT.md` (if you need enterprise scale)
- Development guide: `CLAUDE.md`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Build Errors**: Check Node.js version (needs 18+)
2. **Database Issues**: Ensure migrations have run
3. **WebSocket Issues**: Verify CORS settings and URLs
4. **OAuth Issues**: Double-check callback URLs match exactly
