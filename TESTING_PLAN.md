- [ ] Session management
- [ ] User settings API

### 2. Tool Invocations
- [ ] File operations (`read_file`, `edit_file`, `list_dir`)
- [ ] Code search (`grep_search`, `file_search`, `semantic_search`)
- [ ] Terminal execution (`run_terminal_cmd`)
- [ ] Task management (`todo_write`, `add_memory`, `list_memories`)

### 3. Computer View
- [ ] File explorer interface
- [ ] Directory navigation
- [ ] File content viewing
- [ ] File editing capabilities

### 4. Multiturn Conversations
- [ ] Chat interface functionality
- [ ] Message history
- [ ] Streaming responses
- [ ] Context retention

### 5. Task Management
- [ ] Task creation
- [ ] Task status tracking
- [ ] Task deletion
- [ ] Task details retrieval

### 6. GitHub Integration
- [ ] Repository selection
- [ ] Branch management
- [ ] Issue tracking
- [ ] Pull request generation

### 7. API Endpoints
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Model management
- [ ] User settings
- [ ] Task operations
- [ ] File operations
- [ ] GitHub integration endpoints

## Test Environment Setup

1. Ensure the application is deployed and accessible
2. Set up test user accounts
3. Configure GitHub OAuth credentials
4. Prepare test repositories

## Test Execution Steps

### Phase 1: Authentication Testing
1. Navigate to the application login page
2. Attempt GitHub OAuth login
3. Verify session creation
4. Test user settings API

### Phase 2: Tool Invocation Testing
1. Create a new task with a simple file operation request
2. Verify tool execution and results
3. Test code search capabilities
4. Execute terminal commands
5. Validate task management tools

### Phase 3: Computer View Testing
1. Access file explorer interface
2. Navigate through directory structure
3. View file contents
4. Test file editing functionality

### Phase 4: Multiturn Conversation Testing
1. Initiate a conversation with a complex request
2. Verify context retention across multiple messages
3. Test streaming responses
4. Validate conversation history

### Phase 5: Task Management Testing
1. Create multiple tasks
2. Track task status in real-time
3. Retrieve task details
4. Delete tasks

### Phase 6: GitHub Integration Testing
1. Connect to GitHub repositories
2. Select branches
3. View and create issues
4. Generate pull requests

### Phase 7: API Testing
1. Test all documented API endpoints
2. Verify response formats
3. Test error handling
4. Validate authentication requirements

## Success Criteria

- All core features functional
- Tool invocations execute correctly
- Computer view displays files and directories
- Multiturn conversations maintain context
- Task management works as expected
- GitHub integration functions properly
- All API endpoints respond appropriately
- Error handling is robust

## Test Data

### Test Repositories

### Test Files
- Text files of various sizes
- Code files in different languages
- Binary files

### Test Prompts
- Simple file read request
- Complex code modification request
- Multi-step task request
- Search and replace operation

## Expected Results

### Tool Invocations
- File operations should execute without errors
- Code search should return relevant results
- Terminal commands should execute in isolated environment
- Task management tools should update task status

### Computer View
- File explorer should display directory structure
- File contents should be viewable
- Editing operations should be saved correctly

### Multiturn Conversations
- Context should be maintained across messages
- Streaming should provide real-time updates
- Conversation history should be accessible

### Task Management
- Tasks should be created with proper metadata
- Status updates should be real-time
- Task deletion should remove all associated data

### GitHub Integration
- Repository access should be authenticated
- Branch operations should be accurate
- Issue tracking should sync with GitHub
- Pull requests should be generated correctly

### API Endpoints
- All endpoints should return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Response formats should match documentation
- Error responses should be informative
- Authentication should be enforced

## Reporting

### Test Results Format
- Test case name
- Execution status (Pass/Fail)
- Execution time
- Error details (if failed)
- Screenshots/logs (if applicable)

### Test Summary Report
- Overall pass/fail statistics
- Performance metrics
- Issues discovered
- Recommendations for improvement

## Iteration Process

1. Execute initial test suite
2. Document failures and issues
3. Fix identified problems
4. Re-run failed tests
5. Verify fixes
6. Repeat until 100% pass rate
